MWƐN (mweh-en) unifies sound, body, and intent into a negation-free language of joy. Built on the **Phonemic Triad of Joy** (Ā, Ō, Ū), it replaces opposition with reflection—speech as healing vibration, conversation as sung harmony.

## Key Concepts
- **No Negation:** "I don't want to fail" → "I invite success" (Fear → Aspiration)
- **Partition Operator (□):** A □ B = A B⁻¹ — Zero-flux semantics, no loss of meaning.
- **Morphomic Stacking:** LuLeDuMe = "My sacred light of love."
- **Triad Model:** Chewbacca (vibe) → C-3PO (structure) → R2-D2 (code).
