# MWƐN: The Language of Harmonic Intention 🔊

A foundational linguistic framework designed to unify **phonetic resonance**, **physiology**, and **intention** into a self-sustaining harmonic field of communication.

---

## 🌟 Core Principles

MWƐN (pronounced *mweh-en*) is built upon the **Phonemic Triad of Joy** ($\textbf{Ā}, \textbf{Ō}, \textbf{Ū}$) and operates on the principle of continuity, **eliminating negation** and linguistic opposition.

* **Resonant Communication:** Each utterance is a cymatic expression of consciousness—a living geometry of sound transmitted through resonance.
* **Physiological Harmony:** Language is constructed to induce muscular relaxation and emotional coherence, functioning as a healing vector.
* **Reflective Semantics:** Negation is replaced by reflection (the $\square$ operator), ensuring all communication maintains a forward-directed, affirmative flow.

## 🔠 Key Components

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Phonemic Triad** | $\textbf{Ā}$ (Joy), $\textbf{Ō}$ (Awe), $\textbf{Ū}$ (Peace). All other phonemes are omitted. |
| **Harmonic Modality** | Relational intention is expressed via **musical intervals** (e.g., Perfect Fifth for Joy, Minor Seventh for Curiosity). |
| **Morphomic Stacking** | Meaning is constructed by stacking sacred phonetic units (e.g., *-Du*, *-Le*, *-Sa*). |
| **Partition Operator ($\square$)** | The mathematical operator used to express reflective inversion instead of subtraction/negation. |
